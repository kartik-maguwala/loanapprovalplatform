* Loan Applicant: Who apply for a loan and can be anonymous.
* Front Desk Officer(**ROLE_FRONTDESKOFFICER**): Who perform functionality related to front desk loan department.
* Car Loan Compliance Officer(**ROLE_CARLOANCOMPLIANCE**): Who performs functionality related to car loan compliance.
* Risk Compliance Officer(**ROLE_RISKCOMPLIANCE**): Who performs functionality related to risk compliance.
* Car Loan Disbursal Officer(**ROLE_DISBURSAL**): Who performs functionality related to disbursal.

Run the command to start Keycloak server
```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up
```

To verify, please open http://localhost:9080/

Go to "Administration Console" and use "admin" as username and "admin" as password

## Build Jar artifact
To generate Jar artifact, please run

```
/mvnw clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

The artifact will be generated in "target/loanapprovalplatform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

## Run Application (Dev environment)
To run the application in "dev" environment, please execute
```
java -jar target/loanapprovalplatform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
```

## Run Application (Prod environment)
To run the application in "prod" environment, please execute
```
java -jar target/loanapprovalplatform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

## API documentation (available in Dev environment only)
To open Open API documentation, please use http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config 

## Matrics Collection using Prometheus and Grafana ( Dashboard)
In the application, Prometheus endpoint will be available at http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus

Before start prometheus, please change ```targets: ['<HOST_IP_ADDRESS>:8080']``` property with your host ip address in the "src/main/docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml"

To check host ip address, please run ```ifconfig | grep inet``` in linux environment.
For example, host IP address is "196.168.0.1". The value to property will be ```targets: ['192.168.0.1:8080']```

Before start grafana, please change ```url: http://<HOST_IP_ADDRESS>:9090``` property with your host ip address in the ```src/main/docker/grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasource.yml```.
For example, host IP address is "196.168.0.1". The value to property will be ```url: http://192.168.0.1:9090```


To run prometheus and grafana, please execute
```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/monitoring.yml up
```

To verify, if Prometheus running, please browse http://localhost:9090/targets. The state value of the target should be ```UP```

To open the grafana dashboard, browse http://localhost:3000/ and enter "admin" as username "admin" as password.

Click "skip".
Click "Home" from top left area of the dashboard and click on "JVM (Micrometer)".

## Code quality reports

To run sonarqube, please execute
```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up
```
To verify, please browse http://localhost:9001/
Please setup sonarqube by creating new project named "LoanApprovalPlatform" and set a token.

To push generate the report, execute
```
./mvnw sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=LoanApprovalPlatform \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9001 \
  -Dsonar.login=<TOKEN>
```

Note: Sonarqube takes few seconds to generate the report.

## Build and Run docker images

To build docker images of the application, execute

```
./mvnw jib:dockerBuild
```
It will store docker image in your local docker repository. To verify, please execute

```
docker images
```
There should be docker image named ```loanapprovalplatform```

## CI-CD pipeline (In Progress)

To build CI/CD pipeline, planning to use Jenkin. Added jenkinfile in the project (not tested).

## Testing

It would be best to follow TDD,BDD for better code quality and test automation. May be in future, I'll add some testing
* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Functional tests
* Contract tests
